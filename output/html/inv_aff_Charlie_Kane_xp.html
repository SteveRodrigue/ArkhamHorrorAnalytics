 Charlie Kane promised the people of Arkham a safer future. He made a lot of promises - lower taxes, better schools, less crime. It was part of the job, after all. And although he sometimes had to do things he wasn't proud of, Charlie always did work for the greater good. So when he started hearing the reports, he put the people first. Of course, he couldn't tell anyone. Widespread panic would not serve the public good. Besides, who'd believe him? Still, Charlie has always had connections in town. So he made a few calls, put a task force together, and went to work.<br />
