 Preston Fairmont never thought much about where his family's money came from. All he knew was that he had plenty, and he took great advantage of it whenever possible. His father seemed troubled at times, and tried to explain about his grandfather's business and the demands of something called the Hermetic Order of the Silver Twilight, but Preston never paid any mind. Then his father died in a mysterious car accident, and Preston's family fortune has since become his responsibility. Now Carl Sanford, president of the Silver Twilight Lodge, wants to meet with Preston personally. Perhaps for the first time, Preston has begun to really think about where his family's money came from...<br />
