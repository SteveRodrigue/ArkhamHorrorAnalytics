 After spending a month in jail at the age of 19, George Barnaby felt compelled to become a lawyer. He found great success and notoriety in his career, and as retirement approached he made plans to sail around the world with his wife Maria.

Now, with a lifetime of wealth and contacts at his back, George has tracked the culprits to the city of Arkham, vowing to bring them to justice for their hideous crimes.<br />
