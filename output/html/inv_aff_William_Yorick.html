 William Yorick never wanted to be a gravedigger. He had trained to be an actor and had worked for years in Boston, taking whatever parts were available. Shakespeare was the best stuff, of course, but after many years and hardly any roles, he was forced to admit that the stage was not his destiny. Digging graves was tedious work, but the dead made for an excellent audience, and William always did love a soliloquy. The job took a dark turn when he found degenerate creatures eating the dead in their graves. Ever since that night, Yorick has kept the creatures at bay, using whatever means he can to protect the dead.<br />
