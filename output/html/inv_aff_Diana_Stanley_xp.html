 As a new business owner in Arkham, Diana Stanley was proud to be inducted into the prestigious Silver Twilight Lodge. Her joy has since turned to dread. Her admittance into the organization was fantastic for business, but the weekly meetings have grown more and more disturbing. After witnessing strange rituals and terrible secrets, Diana has become suspicious of the Lodge's true nature. Now she is convinced that there are terrible forces converging on Arkham, and that the Lodge is somehow involved. Diana has resolved to take it down from the inside, regardless of the cost.<br />
