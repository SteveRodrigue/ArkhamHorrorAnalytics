Sister Mary is a fighter (with a dash of clue gathering) and Amanda focuses on clues.

Most of the decks I see with Sister Mary revolve around [.35 Winchester](/card/06195). I tried it for a bit and wasn't satisfied. Her 3 combat base combat is not that high. Also the rifle clogs up the hand and kind of requires [Bandolier](/card/02147) IMO; or you need to give up on other valuable stuff.


Our party (which is usually usually 2-3 real people) will play Mateo's turn by defining his actions using group consen us.  2+ °        ƒK    ƒK          T       ‹å0L  ê@ƒK  @WƒK  pWƒK  †%ƒK   Q ƒK  0ƒK  ‡@ƒK  ê  ƒK  !       ê„ ƒK  †rƒK  ê             « ∫8L  P…H⁄y¿YW0?HÿK  p>HÿK  :LÿK  ∞:LÿK  0:LÿK  2LÿK  ∞1LÿK  p0LÿK  0®LÿK  0.IÿK  ∞ÃIÿK  p:IÿK  0¯JÿK  p5LÿK  ∞UKÿK  0ÒJÿK  p®MÿK  ,HÿK  p)HÿK  0IÿK  p4LÿK  p‹MÿK  ÷MÿK  ∞‹MÿK  0‰IÿK  0ÜIÿK  ∞øIÿK  p›MÿK  p

This deck basically turns him into an octopus and gives him exactly what he needs. 
A lot of brains and arms and tools to do something with.
And if an arm loses a tool, he should be able to pick it up again, 
and that's what this deck is good for.

brains: 
a octopus have 9 brains. To be honest, thats a pretty ambitious goal but Joe can get +5 brains with assets cards plus a chance to buy more with physical training.
he also has skill cards to push it even more in form of steadfast and inquiring mind and unexpected courage for the case of realy bad encounter cards or if the asset cards have not yet been drawn. So 9 brains are a lot but Joe can get there.

arms: 
a octopus have 8 arms. To be honest, 
thats also a pretty ambitious goal but Joe can get there too.
his detective colts let you use 2 tools without hand slots. 
the bandolier gives you two more hand slots for weapons only.
this means you can have the following items all at once:
.45 Automatic pistole + enchanted blade + detective colts 1911 + fingerprint kit + hawk eye folding camera = normally that would be 6 hands and if you take two 2hand tools you are in octopus mode.

tools:
with his 9 brains the octopus is able to use a lot of tools and Joe tries to do the same.
Tetsuo Mori can help you to get tools and weapons faster or to get it back if you already used it or had to discard it.
Scavenging is the most important card in this deck. With Joe¥s high book value it is a very reliable way to get tools and weapons back in your hand. Scavenging lets you use your weapons and tools charges very wasteful with
